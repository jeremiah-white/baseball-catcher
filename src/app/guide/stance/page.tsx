            A general stance most catchers use with the bases empty and less than
            two strikes is called a relaxed stance. The relaxed stance begins by
            squatting with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your hips and
            shoulders square to the pitcher and your feet straight across or
            slightly staggered. Stay low and in a comfortable position. Relax your
            receiving arm (mitt hand) and point your palm at the pitcher. Place
            your throwing hand behind your back or behind your shoe. Present the
            pitcher with a good low target. Read more about a{" "}

          <p>
            Use the ready stance with runners on base and/or two strikes on the
            batter. In both cases you need to be ready to block a wild pitch or
            quickly throw out a base runner. The ready stance is simply a raised
            squat where the weight is now on the balls of your feet instead of the
            instep and your butt is <em>slightly</em> raised. Keep your hips and
            shoulders square to the pitcher, relax your receiving arm, and point
            your palm at the pitcher. Place your throwing hand in a fist behind
            your mitt. Present the pitcher with a good low target. Read more about
            a <Link href="/guide/stance-ready">ready stance</Link>.
