      <h1 className="page-header">Framing Drills for Catchers</h1>

      <p>
        Framing is the art of presenting borderline pitches as strikes. Good
        framing can get your pitcher extra strikes throughout a game. These drills
        will help you develop this subtle but important skill.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Wrist Turns</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Develop the subtle turning motion for framing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a ball, practice the small wrist turn that brings the glove toward
        the strike zone. The movement should be minimal—just enough to present the
        ball well without being obvious. Do 20-30 reps for each location (inside,
        outside, low).
      </p>

      <h3>2. Stick It Drill</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Hold the ball in the strike zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Receive pitches and &quot;stick&quot; them in the zone for a full second before
        moving. This helps you develop the habit of showing the umpire where you
        caught the ball rather than immediately throwing it back.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Corner Work</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Frame pitches on the edges of the zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a pitcher throw to the corners of the strike zone—just barely strikes
        or just barely balls. Work on making the pitches look as good as possible.
        Get feedback from a coach acting as an umpire.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Low Ball Framing</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Frame pitches at the bottom of the zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Low pitches are the hardest to frame and the most valuable when called
        strikes. Work specifically on pitches at the knees. Receive them with your
        thumb down, keep your glove still, and present the ball without dropping
        your glove.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Video Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> See what you look like and make adjustments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Record yourself receiving and framing pitches. Watch the video from the
        umpire&apos;s perspective (behind you). Look for unnecessary movement, obvious
        pulling, or poor presentation. Compare your technique to professional
        catchers.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Quiet Glove Game</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Minimize glove movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Challenge yourself to move your glove as little as possible after catching
        each pitch. The less your glove moves, the better. Have a partner rate
        your movement on a scale of 1-10 for each pitch.
